No One Around source files

Silence is a lie. Something is out there. Maybe inside. Maybe... it’s you.

You find yourself alone on an abandoned voyager, far from home, far from help.
But the silence doesn’t last. The ship creaks. Footsteps echo in the distance. Whispers crawl through the vents.
You fix what breaks — but every fix leaves more questions. Why does everything feel... wrong?

No One Around is a slow-burn psychological horror experience focused on atmosphere, paranoia, and isolation.
There are no monsters. No jump scares. Just the growing fear that you’re not really alone — or worse, that you are.

🛠️ Dynamic malfunctions force you to explore and interact with a fading world.
👂 Unscripted ambient sounds create a sense of unease — every creak might mean something.
🧠 A minimal UI and no hand-holding. Discover the truth through fragments, if you can stay sane long enough.

Will you make it through the loneliness?
